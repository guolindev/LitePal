		Define the database name of your application. 
		By default each database name should be end with .db. 
		If you didn't name your database end with .db, 
		LitePal would plus the suffix automatically for you.
		For example:    
    	<dbname value="demo" />
    -->
    <dbname value="sample" />

    <!--
    	Define the version of your database. Each time you want 
    	to upgrade your database, the version tag would helps.
    	Modify the models you defined in the mapping tag, and just 
    	make the version value plus one, the upgrade of database
    	will be processed automatically without concern.
		For example:    
    	<version value="1" />
    -->
    <version value="1" />

    <!--
    	Define your models in the list with mapping tag, LitePal will
    	create tables for each mapping class. The supported fields
    	defined in models will be mapped into columns.
    	For example:    
    	<list>
    		<mapping class="com.test.model.Reader" />
    		<mapping class="com.test.model.Magazine" />
    	</list>

    <!--
    	Define the cases of the tables and columns name. Java is a
    	case sensitive language, while database is case insensitive.
    	LitePal will turn all classes names and fields names into lowercase
    	by default while creating or upgrading database. Developers can change
    	this behavior into the styles their like. "keep" will keep the
    	cases of classes and fields. "upper" will turn all classes names
    	and fields names into uppercase. "lower" will act as default.
    	Do not change the value after you run your app for the first time,
    	or it might cause the exception that column can not be found.
    	value options: keep lower upper
    	For example:    
    	<cases value="lower" />
    -->

    <!--
        Define where the .db file should be. "internal" means the .db file
        will be stored in the database folder of internal storage which no
        one can access. "external" means the .db file will be stored in the
        path to the directory on the primary external storage device where
        the application can place persistent files it owns which everyone
        can access. "internal" will act as default.
        For example:
        <storage value="external" />
    -->

    <storage value="external" />
